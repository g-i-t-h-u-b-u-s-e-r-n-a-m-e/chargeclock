# Wireless Charging Clock
This is a thingy you can 3d print to combine a General Electric 7-4613b clock, a Deal Worthy wireless charger, and a Woods Christmas light style mini power strip into a clock that charges your phone wirelessly while you sleep. Designed for my dad as a Christmas present (he's had this as an idea since as long as I can remember)
