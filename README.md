# Wireless Charging Clock

This is a thingy you can 3d print to combine a General Electric 7-4613b clock, a Deal Worthy wireless charger, and a Woods Christmas light style mini power strip into a clock that charges your phone wirelessly while you sleep. Designed for my dad as a Christmas present (he's had this as an idea since as long as I can remember)

## Why you shouldn't make this
If you think this project is cool, which you hopefully do, you should still probably not make this. Here's why:

1: There are many very old parts that are no longer in production used here, which can be hard to source & expensive because "vintage"

2: I didn't design this very well. The main problem is you can't change the clock between FM and AM radio, and the radio station changer wheel is hard to use.

3: It's hard to put together. It took me an hour of trial and error with different attatchment methods before I settled on q-tips, which are just okay at best.

4: It uses TONS of filament (figuratively ofc) & takes over 17 hours to print, even with a fast printer

5: It's hard to remove all the supports. They stretch into areas it's hard to get to. I don't think I got all of them on my "completed" example.

6: It uses lots of right angles. This makes it possible to cut yourself on it (speaking from experience)

## If you still want to make it after all of that...

1: Get the parts

2: Print the 3D models

3: Remove any supports

4: Wire everything up according to the 4-letters:

4a: Put the power strip so that the cable goes out the back of the main print & the power strip is stuck at the back

4b: Plug the wall outlet to USB power brick into the power strip

4c: Put the wireless charger in the cutout for it, funnel the USB cable through the hole in the top, & plug in the USB

4d: Plug the clock's cable into the power strip

5: Cut the swab part off the q-tips, then cut the stick parts in half

6: Push the q-tips into both holes on the inside & the hole closest to you on the outside

7: Attatch the top part over the charger using the q-tips

8: Plug it in, set the time, and enjoy!
